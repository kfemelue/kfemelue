## About me

I'm a teacher, and a software engineer. I've been programming professionally for about five years.


I also enjoy:
- Writing poetry, fiction, and songs
- Producing and remixing music
- Eating Good Food
- Traveling
- Gaming (Mostly story driven games and Action RPGs)
- Attending concerts and festivals
- Reading Manga
- Science Fiction, especially when it features cyberpunk and solarpunk content
- Wordplay, puns, corny jokes

Some of my favorite movies are:
1. Princess Mononoke (1997)

2. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)    
    (*specifically* because of the music that plays at the battle for Helm's Deep)

3. Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)

4. The Tragedy of MacBeth (2021)

5. The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)

6. GATTACA (1997)
